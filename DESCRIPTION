Package: lazyraster
Version: 0.5.0
Title: Generate Raster Data Lazily from 'GDAL'
Description: Read raster data at a specified resolution on-demand via 'GDAL' 
 (the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library <https://gdal.org/>). Augments the 
 'raster' package by never reading data from a raster source until necessary for 
 generating an in-memory 'raster' object. A 'lazyraster' object may be cropped 
 and converted to 'raster' object, and by default will only read a small amount 
 of data sufficient for an overall summary. The amount of data read can be 
 controlled by specifying the output dimensions.
